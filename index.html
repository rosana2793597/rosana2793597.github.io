	<h1><p> What I like the most about friends is the comedy, and how the cast, represent their characters. Also the transformation each one suffered during the show that proves that with a lot of effor nothing is imposible, a clear of this example is Rachel, a rich girl daughter of daddy, became a sucessfull bussiness woman, working at the great fashion indistry, somethimg that she has always wanted, getting more and more job offers, at better comapanies.</p> </h1>
	
	<h1> <p> Or Ross, who got over the fact that he had divorced three times, he was a good palantheologist, with two beautiful children; and at the end he finished together with the love of his life.</p> </h1>
	
	<h1><p> If you have watched friends, you understand the emotion, when characters in the show make their dreams come true. </p> </h1>

<h1><p>Friends is amazing, it became one of my favorite series a year ago, in my opinion it defined a generation, and it continues, is an hilarious show, i really love it. With the pass of the chapters I started finding a piece of me in each character, in a way they made me feel part of their world. Even when friends was first broadcast in the 1990´s and finished when I was just a baby, Friends is simply evergreen. This show made us have unforgettable moments. </p>	</h1>

<h1><p>I really love this series, in my opinion it defined a generation, even when the bases of the program are about comedy, it does have a message, just imagine, Friends was about to finish, when I was three years old, and some time later, it got the heart of a fifteen year old teenager. Last year my best friend recommended it to me, I wasn´t that sure to spend so much time, watching ten seasons of what I thought was lame and silly, but after the first episode, it shut my mouth up, and showed me it is really worth it, then I realize, I was in watching my favorite TV sitcom.</p> </h1>
